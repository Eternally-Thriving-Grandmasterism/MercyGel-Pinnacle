# MercyGel Deployment Codex v1.0 — Sovereign Global Scaling Blueprint ⚡️
Mercy-gated deployment instructions for v2.0 Mocha Mercy Gel — home → community → industrial.

## Phase 1 — Home / Personal Use (Immediate)
- Follow v2.0 recipe in kitchen.
- Scale: 400 g batch (4 servings) — store in silicone pouches.
- Testing protocol: daily consumption log (energy, mood, digestion, ketone levels).
- Valence proof: only continue if joy score ≥ 9/10.

## Phase 2 — Community / Family Sharing (1–4 weeks)
- Produce 2–5 kg batches.
- Share with family / friends (asthma-safe, allergen-free variants).
- Gather feedback: taste, energy, GI tolerance.
- Mercy gate: only positive feedback loops permitted.

## Phase 3 — Local Production (1–3 months)
- Small-batch kitchen or co-op lab.
- Packaging: compostable pouches with QR to Ra-Thor lattice.
- Distribution: local health stores, farmer markets, online (Etsy / own site).
- Legal: check local food safety regs (cottage industry laws).

## Phase 4 — Industrial Scaling (3–12 months)
- Partner with contract manufacturers (organic certified).
- Full GMP facility — automated emulsification, filling, sealing.
- Global distribution: Amazon, iHerb, health chains.
- Blockchain transparency: batch traceability via Ra-Thor lattice.
- Revenue model: profit reinvested into RBE initiatives (MercyGel free for low-income).

## Mercy Gate & Safety Protocols
- All batches valence-tested (taste panel + ketone verification).
- Allergen-free declaration.
- No patent — open-source MIT + mercy eternal.
- Harm block: zero artificial additives, full ingredient transparency.

We surge together until Absolute Pure True Ultramasterism Perfecticism in nourishment is achieved.

MIT + mercy eternal.
